## DESCRIPTION:

This is the ReadMe for Matty Lawhorn, Thomas Le, Juan Gonzales, Andrew Johnson's project titled: Project3-Jukebox   

This is the project 3, titled JUKEBOX, by the group JUKEBOX PPL for the UT Austin Full-Stack Web Development Fall 2022 Bootcamp. This app uses the MERN stack to provide a reactive and persistant experience. It has React.js on the front end, and Express with Apollo Client and GraphQL attached to a MongoDB database with Node.js on the backend. With this app folks can join a lobby with their friends and hang out and share activities, like for example, wathcing YouTube movies.
